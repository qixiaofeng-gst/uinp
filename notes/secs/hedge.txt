High Freguency Trading
The common types of high-frequency trading include several types of market-making, event arbitrage, statistical arbitrage, and latency arbitrage.
Most high-frequency trading strategies are not fraudulent, but instead exploit minute deviations from market equilibrium.

Treat investment as business, four principles available:
1. Know what you are doing — know your business.
2. Do not let anyone else run your business, unless
  (1) you can supervise his performance with adequate care and comprehension or
  (2) you have unusually strong reasons for placing implicit confidence in his integrity and ability.
3. Do not enter upon an operation — that is, manufacturing or trading in an item — unless a reliable calculation shows that it has a fair chance to yield a reasonable profit.
  In particular, keep away from ventures in which you have little to gain and much to lose.
4. Have the courage of your knowledge and experience.
  If you have formed a conclusion from the facts and if you know your judgment is sound, act on it — even though others may hesitate or differ.
